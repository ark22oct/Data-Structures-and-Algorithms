# Data Structures and Algorithms
Lab work for Data Structures and Algorithms accomplished using C. Feel free to reference, but avoid copying.

Exploring fundamental concepts and advanced techniques essential for effective software development comprehensively. Covering a range of topics, from basic data structures to sophisticated algorithms and software engineering principles, gaining a deep understanding of the tools and methodologies crucial for building robust, scalable systems. Topics covered include basic data structures (arrays, pointers), abstract data structures (trees, lists, heaps), searching, sorting, hashing, recursive algorithms, parsing, space-time complexity, NP-complete problems, software engineering and project management, object-oriented data structures. Case studies and lab exercises will be implemented using a high level programming language.

# Key Objectives
1. Structured methods for engineering software design
   
3. Process of the problem-to-program and an introduction to "big O" and "big Omega" notation.
   
4. Principal internal sorting algorithms: quicksort, heapsort, binsort, and the simpler, less efficient methods such as insertion sort. Linear-time algorithms are also covered.
   
5. Traditional list, stack and queue structures. Also, mapping an abstract data type based on the mathematical notion of a function.
   
6. Introduction to abstract data types based on the mathematical model of a set. Implementations of stacks and queues. Introduction to hash tables and binary search trees.
    
7. Graphs, including directed and undirected graphs, for the implementation of graph algorithms. Introduction to data structures for graph representation. Presentation of a number of      graph algorithms, including depth-first search, generating minimal spanning trees, shortest paths, etc.
 
8. Asymptotic analysis of recursive procedures, including recurrence relations.
 
9. Introduction to designing algorithms, dynamic programming, local search algorithms, and various forms of tree searching.
 
10. Analysis of algorithm complexity.
